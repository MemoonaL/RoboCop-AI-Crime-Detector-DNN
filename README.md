# RoboCop-AI-Crime-Detector-DNN
Imagine a futuristic city run by AI. The government deploys a Robot Police Cop (powered by a Deep Neural Network) to predict whether a person will commit a crime. But… the robot starts failing , it overfits to past crime data and can’t generalize to new situations. Now we retrain it with regularization to make it smarter and fairer.
